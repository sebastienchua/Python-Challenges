#Exercise 1: Change the code for a celebrity of your choice.
StephenAmellBorn = 1981
MyAge = int(input('When were you born?'))
AgeDifferenceOne = (MyAge-StephenAmellBorn)
print("Stephen Amell is", AgeDifferenceOne, " years older than you")
#Exercise 2: Change the code so that you can compare any celebrity to yourself.
MyYearOfBirth = 2003
CelebrityAge = int(input("In what year was the celebrity you wish to compare with born?"))
AgeDifferenceTwo = (MyYearOfBirth-CelebrityAge)
print("Sebastien, this celebrity is", AgeDifferenceTwo, "years apart from you.")

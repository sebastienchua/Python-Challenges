#Exercise 1: Paste in the following code. What happens if you:
#a. Remove the indent
#b. Type in a capital Y
#c. Change the "y" to "Y"
#I tried all of the above, and it causes the code to stop working.
#Exercise 2: Change the code to be more flexible. Can you also allow 'yes" too?
#Exercise 3: It would be great to add a statement that if it's not raining, we can play. Have a look at this code.
#else:print("Great we can play!")What's wrong with it?

test = input("Is it raining? y/n ")
if test in ["Y","y","Yes","yes"]:
    print("Oh dear, no football today!")
else:
    print("Great we can play!")

#A data logger records the temperature of the roof of a school twice a day, at midday and midnight
#Input and store the temperatures recorded for a month.
#You must store the temperatures in two one-dimensional arrays,
#one for the midday temperatures and one for the midnight temperature
#All the temperatures must be validated on entry and any invalid temperatures rejected.
#You must decide your own validation rules. You may assume that there are 30 days in a month.

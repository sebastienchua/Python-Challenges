# Alright, so basically I'm having a problem with this TASK 3 
#Calculate the overall winner and how many times they won with each type of object.
# The problem is since I used an index to try and be clever, I don't know where to actually record the objects, I just printed the object 
that won after each individual game, and used that to total up.

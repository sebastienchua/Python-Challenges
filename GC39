#STUDENT CREATED: THE ROASTING MACHINE
#The Random Insult Generator. You have horrible comebacks, and just keep on getting roasted by everyone.
#This code will help you take your revenge. It must ask for the studentâ€™s name, and include that when roasting.
#There must be a random generator based upon a list.
